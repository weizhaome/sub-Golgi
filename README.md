# sub-Golgi
The bechmark dataset(G3-199) extract Golgi resident proteins from Uniprot released on October 2017, which includes 199 protein sequences,classfied into three sub-Golgi locations.
Among the G3-199 dataset, 33 of them belong to cis-Golgi network, 42 of them belong to Golgi stack, 124 of them belong to trans-Golgi network. 
The G3-199 dataset was used to construct a svm model for predicting protein three sub-Golgi locations.
